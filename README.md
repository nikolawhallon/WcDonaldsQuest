# WcDonaldsQuest

WcDonald's Quest represents next generation drive-through AI experiences through a cutting-edge, multi-dimensional,
paradigm shift that will revolutionize the industry through disruptive technology.

Actually it's just a techo-demo game where you drive a Yugo up to a WcDonald's restaurant
and order Bepis and Conke by talking to an AI agent with your microphone. It is an example of a more complete client
experience to the bepis-lite server here:

While the bepis-lite repo hosts a bepis-lite cli client, it is fun to use a game/game engine as a
client/front-end. Especially since I can't code any html/css/js.

To run this, you will need to edit `Game.gd` to add your Deepgram API Key where it says `INSERT_API_KEY`.
Also note that this game relies on https://wcdonaldsquest.deepgram.com being up and alive, something
I won't guarantee ever.
